# Marketing Campaign based on Phone Calls

A banking institution ran a direct marketing campaign based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed or not. The task is to predict whether someone will subscribe to the term deposit or not based on the given information.
